        <p>     
            My name is Javori but I usually go by Javi. I am a front-end web developer in training, currently a student in the Thinkful 
            Engineering Immersion program. I initially started college wanting to be an electrical engineer. I took my first C++ course 
            and got intimidated after I fell behind my classmates. I gave up and decided to pursue a career in business, but after struggling
            through college in courses and reaching a dead end in my life where I didn't know if I was doing what I wanted. I was informed by 
            a few software engineering friends that coding is the future and now is the best time to get into it. I always realized that I was a
            creator at heart, and decided that I shouldn't give up on my dreams so quickly, just because I had to work harder than normal.
            I have huge aspirations when it comes to pursuing a career in web development. I want to create my own projects, but also I want to
            help out on huge projects, and improve my knowledge and skills in the field.
        </p><br>

           <p> Other than coding, I love football [Go Eagles!!] and basketball [Go Bulls!!]. I also enjoy spending my off-time playing video       
            games and trying to master the guitar.
